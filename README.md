# EvoRand

# Introduction

EvoRand is the tool combining search-based and random testing generation technique to enhance the bug detection capabilities of generated tests with diverse inputs. Combining the two methods makes EvoRand possible to effectively create tests that put various inputs into a program while maintaining high code coverage.

This repository was created to anonymously share the experimental data of EvoRand paper. In a `rq_data` folder, you can find three separated folders that are named `rq1`, `rq2`, and `rq3` respectively. In each folder, the Markdown file is located so that you can find the information of the data.
